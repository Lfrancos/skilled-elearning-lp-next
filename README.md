## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

When working on this exercise something clicked with how I position the images, before I was really scared of positioning the images in places that where not in line with the layout of the page, but now I was able to see that I can use
```
    position: relative;
```
 on the image container, and then
 ```
    position: absolute;
    transform: translate(x,y);
 ```
on the image, that way it keeps the layout order and I'm able to place the image where I want to place it.
I think this is going to help me a lot when it comes to really hard designs.

### Continued development

I really need to pay more attention to how I use git, I need to make sure that I'm adding commits more incrementally, right now I'm adding them after a lot of changes have happened and it is really hard to go back since going back means losing a lot of work.
Also would be nice to really take advantage of git I feel like the things that I'm using are the very basic things and I'm missing of a lot of functionalities.
This may be because this tool works best when working on teams and for now I'm working on my own.
Git is something that I really want to keep working on.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
